Fomos super bem recebidos com uma grande simpatia e predisposição a ajudar com qualquer coisa que fosse necessário.\r\nA casa era ainda melhor do que parecia nas fotos, totalmente equipada, com mantas, aquecedor e tudo o que pudessemos precisar.\r\nA localização não podia ser melhor! Não há melhor do que acordar de manhã e ao virar da esquina estar a ribeira do Porto.",

It's perfect to have such an appartment to your disposal, you feel home, and have a place to relax between the exploration of this very nice city.\r\nWe thank Ana & Gonçalo, and we hope the appartment is free when we go back next year.

          "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend.",

          "Ana und Gonçalo sind sehr hilfsbereite liebe Leute, die  alles tun, damit man sich wohl fühlt. Wenn es etwas zu beanstanden gab, wird das sofort problemlos erledigt. Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. ",

          "This apartment is in the perfect location for being in the middle of the action. There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.",

          "Probably Ana&Gonzalo´s place is great for summer but definitely not in winter. The house is NOT WARM and ready for a stay in cold and humit season. There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house.",

L'accueil a ete très chaleureux: Nous étions trompé d'adresse car le GPS avaient confondus les rues mais Ana a su nous retrouver pour nous amener à l'appartement.  L'appartement était très  propre et nous avons eu largement tout ce qu'il fallait en linge.\nEncore un Grand merci à eux!",

In less than 10 minutes u’re in Vila Nova De Gaia where u can find the wineries of porto’s wine.\nThe apartment is really spacious and comfortable, perfect for 7 italian people that want to have fun in Oporto.\nSuggested!!!",

You do have to hold the shower wand when showering but the pressure is good. Overall I would definitely stay in the apartment again!",

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.",

          "The house was extremely well located and Ana was able to give us some really great tips on locations to have lunch and eat out. The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \n\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.",
